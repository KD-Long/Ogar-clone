Ogar clone:

1) Write docs to reproduce
2) Deploy to appengine (how can you mod on the fly?)
3) features:
    - add some more skins
    - leaderboard with score
    - easy deploy to appengine



Notes: fror setup:
1) Need node 14
    - Change 


MutiOgar:
    1) MultiOgarII/src/config.js : change port 88 to 8888 "serverStatsPort": 8888, (port not open on vms)

Cigar:
    1) Cigar2/package.json chnage to node 14 "node": "14.x"
    2) Cigar2/web/index.html `Change from local host to your server (external IP)
                    <option value="34.87.231.236:443" selected>34.87.231.236: 443</option>
                    <option value="34.87.231.236:8080" selected>34.87.231.236 8080</option>




Things that caused problems:
1) installing node
2) upgrading to node 14 (https://phoenixnap.com/kb/update-node-js-version)
3) setting static external IP so it doesnt change
4) adding ingress/egress fire wall rules for anyone on the web 0.0.0.0/0 to any port (should test only 3000 port tcp) 
5) creating a golink / customer domain

** cannot do an domain name e.g ...appspot.com:3000 doesnt work


####### notes
server:
https://ogar-server-dot-kdlong-premium.ts.r.appspot.com
client:
https://ogar-client-dot-kdlong-premium.ts.r.appspot.com



 --- $nohup npm start &
The nohup means the command should ignore “hang ups” and the ampersand & appended to it is a shell command that tells the system to run the command as background process.





#### run this command to start (won't die when you exit ssh)
nohup npm start </dev/null

### use this command to check its running (8888 stats server, 8080 game server, 3000 cigar client)
sudo netstat -tulpn

server is reachable by app engine domain name

Switching to felx to support port forwarding
flex doesnt support node v12
    -need to change code


   getSpecTarget() {
        if(this.spectateTarget!= null && spectateTarget.isRemoved)
             this.spectateTarget = null;
        if(this.spectateTarget == null || this.spectateTarget==undefined)
            return this.server.largestClient
        else
            return this.spectateTarget
    }

    Hi, we are passing this case across regions today: go/sf/27323994
just need a TSE to hold, and if customer reports issue again, bump to P1
